### [Deepfakes_faceswap](#deepfakes)

- **Deepfake is a tool that utilizes deep learning to recognize and swap faces in pictures and videos.** [[code]](https://github.com/deepfakes/faceswap) | [[forum]](https://forum.faceswap.dev/)

     
### [FaceSwap-MarekKowalski](#faceswap)

- **FaceSwap is an app that have originally created as an exercise for students in "Mathematics in Multimedia".** [[code]](https://github.com/MarekKowalski/FaceSwap) | [[homepage]](http://home.elka.pw.edu.pl/~mkowals6/doku.php)
     
### [FaceShifter](#faceshifter)

- **FaceShifter: Towards High Fidelity And Occlusion Aware Face Swapping.** *CVPR 2020* [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.13457.pdf) | [[homepage]](https://lingzhili.com/)

     Faceshifter is a novel two-stage framework for high fidelity and occlusion aware face-swapping. It's able to generate high fidelity identity preserving face swap results and, in comparison to previous methods, deal with facial occlusions using a second synthesis stage consisting of a Heuristic Error Acknowledging Refinement Network (HEAR-Net). 
     - in the first stage, generate the swapped face in high-fidelity by exploiting and integrating the target attributes thoroughly and adaptively.
     - in the second stage, propose a novel Heuristic Error Acknowledging Refinement Network (HEAR-Net) to address the challenging facial occlusions.
     
     
### [Nirkin et al.](#Nirkin)

- **On face segmentation, face swapping, and face perception..** *FG 2018* [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.13457.pdf) | [[homepage]](https://lingzhili.com/)

     *Yuval Nirkin, Iacopo Masi, Anh Tran Tuan, Tal Hassner, and Gerard Medioni.*
     
     - Instead of tailoring systems for face segmentation, as others previously proposed, this work shows that a standard fully convolutional network (FCN) can achieve remarkably fast and accurate segmentations, provided that it is trained on a rich enough example set.
     - use special image segmentations to enable robust face swapping under unprecedented conditions.
     - measure the effect of intra- and inter-subject face swapping on recognition. Generally speaking, intra-subject swapped faces remain as recognizable as their sources, while better face swapping produces less recognizable inter-subject results.
