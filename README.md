# deepfake-models
List some popular deepfake models e.g. FaceSwap, FaceShifter, FSGAN, etc.


### [Deepfakes_faceswap](#deepfakes)

- **FaceSwap is a tool that utilizes deep learning to recognize and swap faces in pictures and videos.** [[code]](https://github.com/deepfakes/faceswap) | [[forum]](https://forum.faceswap.dev/)

     
### [FaceSwap-MarekKowalski](#faceswap)

- **FaceSwap is an app that have originally created as an exercise for students in "Mathematics in Multimedia".** [[code]](https://github.com/MarekKowalski/FaceSwap) | [[homepage]](http://home.elka.pw.edu.pl/~mkowals6/doku.php)
     
### [FaceShifter](#faceshifter)

- **FaceShifter: Towards High Fidelity And Occlusion Aware Face Swapping.** *CVPR 2020* [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.13457.pdf) | [[homepage]](https://lingzhili.com/)

     *Lingzhi Li, Jianmin Bao, Hao Yang, Dong Chen, Fang Wen.*
     
Faceshifter is able to generate high fidelity identity preserving face swap results and, in comparison to our previous methods, deal with facial occlusions using a second synthesis stage consisting of a Heuristic Error Acknowledging Refinement Network (HEAR-Net).
